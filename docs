        [implemented]

    Write to CSV File:
        Write data from a structured format to a CSV file.
        [implemented]

    Custom Delimiters:
        Allow users to specify custom delimiters (comma, semicolon, tab, etc.).
        [implemented]

    Headers:
        Support reading and writing CSV files with or without headers.

    Row Manipulation:
        Insert, update, or delete rows in a CSV file.

    Column Manipulation:
        Extract, insert, or delete columns in a CSV file.

    Filtering:
        Provide the ability to filter rows based on certain conditions.

    Sorting:
